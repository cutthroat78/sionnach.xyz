| [Renfield (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11358390/) | Yes | 5/10 | I found this film boring and uninteresting. I liked the premise, but found the execution boring and missing potential. I felt the acting was weak and awkward at parts and found Nicolas Cage's acting in this nothing special and not entertaining like he is in other movies. The action scenes were fun though. | I watched this casually at home and wasn't paying full attention at small parts. Perhaps a more attentive viewing would make me enjoy it less or more, though I will not be rushing to rewatch this. |
