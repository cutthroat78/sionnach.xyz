## Review/Comment

I really liked this game. The graphics still hold up and the gameplay is great. Ever level has a few ways to kill your target(s) and complete your objectives that bring a great amount of replay value to each level. The stealth is fun. Figuring out enemies' patterns, what will set them off, when and how to distract them and what to do next is a really enjoyable and having shoot outs can be super fun to do, especially when annoyed. Getting all the level achievements and play styles is enjoyable to figure out and do. I did have a couple times where I had to lookup what they are or how to do them, because I couldn't figure them out myself, but that has more to do with me not being able to figure out than the game's fault. I did encounter some bugs every once and a while with the level achievements, but not any that were game breaking, most of the time when I did encounter such a bug, I just had to redo what was needed to do the level achievement and it worked. I liked the story. There isn't a lot in it, it is quite simple, but I like that. The game doesn't take up too much time with cutscenes and non-gameplay story stuff, which allows you to get into and immersed in the game fast, without boring you with loads of story and exposition. This story is perfect for a Hitman game. The voice acting is quite good and enjoyed most actor's performances. The ragdolls physics is also can be funny when dragging bodies around or blowing people up. I do wish this game was a little longer as I would imagine someone who isn't 100 percenting it would get the game done quite quickly. Unfortunately, the contracts feature is no longer available as the servers were taken down years ago, so I wasn't able to try it out, get the achievements for the contracts mode or earn any money to be able to buy weapons (you can't unlock, you have to buy (with in game currency)) and upgrades for the weapons and that meant I couldn't try any of the (buy only) weapons or upgrades for the weapons. Despite that, my overall experience with this game was positive and this game has really made me want to play all of the Hitman games in the series to see how they compare to each other

## Notes

This review it messy, because I wrote it very quickly in one stream of consciousness. This is my first Hitman game. I may update this review when I play more of the games and I might update to make it less messy and better
