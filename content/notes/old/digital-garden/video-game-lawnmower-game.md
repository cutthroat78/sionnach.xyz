## Review/Comment

Funny, simple and cheap game to play for a few minutes, or get all the achievements for and put on your steam profile as a joke

- Good:
  - Cheap and it is also often on special
  - The game is simple and anybody could understand it and know how to play
  - The idea is funny and it is funny to play in an ironic way
    - You can put it on your steam profile as a joke
  - Very few and easy to get achievements
    - That you can put on your steam profile as a joke
  - Pumpkins are somewhat easy to find and help you explore the environment
  - Going for a high score or trying to beat other people's score could be fun for some people
  - You can mow the lawns of the houses, not just the fields
  - Two camera angles, one third person, the other first person
  - Simple controls
    - You only need one hand to play
    - Mouse doesn't do anything
  - Simple tutorial that is also optional
  - Fuel is easy to find and get
  - Jump right into the game, nothing delaying you from mowing that lawn
  - Game can run in background, so you can do other things on your computer while you idle to get certain achievements
  - You could play this as a form of mindfulness or meditation as you could focus on actively playing this game without much distraction, because the game is so simple
    - Playing in first person could help with this
    - Things you could focus on as playing this game as a form of mindfulness or meditation
      - Controlling the game and the lawnmower
      - The sound of the lawnmower
      - Certain things in the environment or on the lawnmower
      - The way the grass changes from uncut to cut behind the lawnmower
  - You can lower the graphics if your system has trouble playing the game at higher graphics
    - Lowering the graphics really low and seeing the garbled mess is fun to do
- Okay/Neutral:
  - Environment is alright to look at and explore
  - It is very hard to lose at this game
  - The game has no story
  - The game has no cutscenes
  - Graphics aren't very good, but that is understandable for an Indie studio or person who made this quickly or in a short amount of time
  - The lawnmower is automatic transmission, so you don't have to deal with changing gears yourself
    - Some people may prefer to change gears themself as it would give more to do and manage
- Bad:
  - Game can get boring after a minute or more
    - When it gets boring is different for everyone
  - Game doesn't have Trading Cards on Steam
  - Bad English grammar and spelling
    - No issue to me, but may be for other people
  - You can get stuck and be forced to restart or wait out until you run out of fuel
    - I got stuck once on the rocks that were around river
  - When I select a resolution above 1280x720, the game looks the same as when it was on 1280x720
  - Performance
    - Lag spikes when turning sometimes
    - Screen tearing happens often for me
  - The game doesn't have any leaderboards for high scores and doesn't even save your own high score
  - Sound Design
    - There is no music in game, only in the menu
    - The lawnmower sound can sound relaxing, but it could also be annoying or boring to people as the sound never changes
    - Pumpkin sound was quite loud and did frighten me the first time
    - Fuel sound is okay, but nothing special

## Tips and Tricks

- To get the "Play 60 minutes in row" achievement, keep the game running in the background while you do other things and come back to it every once and a while to get fuel, so you don't lose
  - You could do this trick for the "Play 10 minutes" and "Play 15 minute" achievement

## Notes

- In my game, the fuel canisters were a dark green, but other gameplay and the tutorial shows and says it is yellow
- Perhaps, my game ran poorly due to my setup, but with how simple and non-intensive this game is or should be I feel this isn't the case
  - The game does look to run better in other people's gameplay, so I am not sure why I got the performance issues I got
