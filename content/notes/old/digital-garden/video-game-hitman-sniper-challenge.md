## Review/Comment

A very short, but fun pre-order bonus that you get by buying [*Hitman: Absolution*]({{<ref video-game-hitman-absolution.md>}}) normally now. It is a single mission that is just doing one of my favourite things to do in [*Hitman: Absolution*]({{<ref video-game-hitman-absolution.md>}}) sniping. There is attachments to work towards using the total points from all the times you have played the mission and the challenges in the mission to complete, which are enjoyable to figure out and do. I finished this game 100% in one sitting

## Notes

This game was originally a pre-order bonus, but now comes with [*Hitman: Absolution*]({{<ref video-game-hitman-absolution.md>}}), when bought on Steam
