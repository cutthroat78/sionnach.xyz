The Microsoft Dingbat Fonts include the fonts:
- Wingdings 1 (Also Known As: W.D. Gaster's Alphabet)
- Wingdings 2
- Wingdings 3
- Webdings

I have and have seen other people use these dingbat fonts as [ciphers](_index.md) online and a couple of times in real life, hence why this page is under ciphers.

## Wingdings

Wingdings is a series of [dingbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat) fonts that render letters as a variety of symbols. They were originally developed in 1990 by Microsoft by combining glyphs from Lucida Icons, Arrows, and Stars licensed from Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes.

### Wingdings 1 in Undertale

In the game [Undertale](https://undertale.com/about/), there are some easter eggs with a character named [W.D. Gaster](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/W._D._Gaster) who uses Wingdings 1 in their text dialogues. One thing to note is that W.D. Gaster only uses uppercase characters in their text dialogues and never uses lowercase. It seems some people were introduced to Wingdings (1) and introduced to using it as a cipher from seeing it in Undertale.

## Webdings

Webdings is a TrueType [dingbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat) typeface developed in 1997. It was initially distributed with Internet Explorer 4.0, then as part of Core fonts for the Web, and is included in all versions of Microsoft Windows since Windows 98.
