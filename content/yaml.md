YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language that is commonly used for configuration files and for storing or transmitting data in applications

I have seen YAML stand for "Yet Another Markup Language", however YAML's [official website](https://yaml.org/) says it stands for "YAML Ain’t Markup Language"
