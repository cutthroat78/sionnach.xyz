title: "Recommended Reading"
---

This is my personal list of texts and videos that I recommend for people to read. These texts and videos are not only ones I enjoy, but I have learned something from and each one has contributed to my [Critical Self-Theory](#critical-thinking-and-critical-self-theory).

There is also a good amount of resources in here as they are handy tools for learning more or helping people get access to what we need and want.

Unfortunately, I can't maintain this page as much as I would like to, so it is possible for links to go dead or resources on this page to become irrelevant or available over time.

As per the nature of [Critical Self-Theory](#critical-thinking-and-critical-self-theory), not all of these texts, videos or resources I 100% agree with or believe to be 100% true, but from all of them I do take in, at varying levels depending on the text, video or resource, knowledge, points, ideas or counterarguments. Sometimes I will leave notes under an entry on this page to give a short, but clear idea of what I think, got out of the entry and/or what I think of the entry.

## Introduction

Each of these are a text or video that I recommend for anyone who is a beginner to anarchism to read, though many of them do, not all of them are exactly set out to introduce you to anarchism

- Text: [*Basic Principles of Anarchism* by *Morpheus*](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/morpheus-basic-principles-of-anarchism)

### Resources (For Beginners)

- Resource: [The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org)
  - An archive of texts on anarchism. Very accessible website with many options to help with reading. Often times if you are looking for a text or texts on a particular topic, it will be on here
- Resource: [An Anarchist FAQ](https://www.anarchistfaq.org/afaq/index.html)
  - Great resource for answering all types of questions. If you have a particular question or just want to hear what Anarcho might have said about a particular topic, then it is worth looking for it in The Anarchist FAQ. Makes great starting points for conversations or research (especially [Critical Self-Theory](#critical-thinking-and-critical-self-theory) inspired research)
- Resource: [AnarWiki](https://anarwiki.org/)
  - A new (as of writing this) wiki attempting to be a comprehensive encyclopaedia of anarchist concepts, history, literature, and people
- Resource: [AF2C (Anarchist Federation of Cyber Communes)](https://af2c.org)
  - An effort to link existing and generate new organizations that operate according to anarchist principles. They offer many web-services that I believe are worth checking out

## Theory, Praxis (Taking Action) and Philosophy

I used to keep the "Praxis (Taking Action)" and the "Theory and Philosophy" sections separate, but over time as I added more and more I wasn't able to easily separate texts, videos and resources into these two categories, so it made more sense to push them together. I am not sure if it would be possible for me to keep the "Prefiguration" and "Confrontation" headings below as I might have the same issue as I did with "Praxis (Taking Action)" and "Theory and Philosophy", but for now they stay.

- Text: [*Destabilization of Russia as a way to freedom in Belarus* by *Prameń*](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/pramen-destabilization-of-russia-as-a-way-to-freedom-in-belarus)
  - Note: I mostly like this text and I agree with it's conclusion, however, based off what I know from some other Eastern European and Slavic comrades (including those who belong to some ethnic minorities in Russia), a point has been made that Russia doesn't necessarily have to broken up or "balkanised" and that it may be preferable for it to keep some type of federation or confederation structure that allows oblasts, areas and ethnic minorities to choose whether they want to leave or stay in this (con)federation structure, which, to me, maintains the idea of autonomy from the ground up 

#### Russia's Invasion of Ukraine
